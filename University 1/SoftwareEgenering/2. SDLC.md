- **Tools & Techniques:**
    
    - **Project Management:** Gantt Charts, PERT Diagrams.
    - **Risk Assessment:** SWOT Analysis, Risk Matrix.
    - **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify key stakeholders and engagement plans.

---

### **Stage 2 - Analysis**

- **Objective:** Gather and document software requirements.
    
- **Key Activities:**
    
    - **Requirement Gathering:** Interviews, surveys, observations.
    - **Use Cases:** Define interactions between users and system.
    - **Functional Specifications:** Define what the system **must** do.
- **Example:**
    
    - **E-commerce website requirements**:
        - **User needs:** Secure payments, product reviews, easy navigation.
        - **Business needs:** Inventory management, sales reporting.
- **Techniques:**
    
    - **User Stories & Personas:** “As a [user], I want [feature] so that [reason].”
    - **Requirements Prioritization:** MoSCoW Method, Kano Model.

---

### **Stage 3 - Design**

- **Objective:** Create the blueprint for the system.
    
- **Types of Design:**
    
    - **Architectural Design:** System structure and components.
    - **Database Design:** Data models and relationships.
    - **User Interface (UI/UX) Design:** Interaction and usability.
- **Example:**
    
    - **Cloud-based storage system architecture**:
        - Choose **monolithic vs. microservices**.
        - Plan **data storage and security**.

---

### **Stage 4 - Implementation**

- **Objective:** Convert design into working software through coding.
    
- **Best Practices:**
    
    - **Consistent naming conventions & documentation**.
    - **Modular programming** for maintainability.
    - **Version Control Systems:** Git, SVN.
- **Tools:**
    
    - **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):** Visual Studio, Eclipse.
    - **Code Review Practices:** Peer Reviews, Automated Quality Checks.
    - **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Deployment):** Jenkins, GitLab CI.

---

### **Stage 5 - Testing**

- **Objective:** Identify defects and ensure software meets requirements.
    
- **Types of Testing:**
    
    - **Unit Testing:** Test individual components.
    - **Integration Testing:** Ensure module interactions work.
    - **System Testing:** Test the complete system.
    - **Acceptance Testing:** Validate business requirements.
- **Example:**
    
    - **Web app testing using Selenium:**
        - Simulate user actions across browsers.
        - Automate testing workflows.
- **Testing Tools:**
    
    - **Unit Testing:** JUnit, NUnit.
    - **UI Testing:** Selenium, Appium.
    - **Performance Testing:** JMeter, LoadRunner.
    - **Bug Tracking:** JIRA, Bugzilla, Trello.

---

### **Stage 6 - Deployment**

- **Objective:** Release the software in a controlled manner.
- **Deployment Strategies:**
    - **Phased Rollout:** Release to limited user groups first.
    - **Blue-Green Deployment:** Maintain two parallel environments to prevent downtime.

---

### **Stage 7 - Maintenance**

- **Objective:** Ensure long-term functionality and efficiency.
- **Types of Maintenance:**
    - **Corrective:** Fixing bugs and security issues.
    - **Adaptive:** Updating software for environmental changes.
    - **Perfective:** Enhancing performance and maintainability.

---

### **SDLC Models**

8. **Waterfall Model:** Sequential, linear approach; each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
9. **Agile Methodologies:**
    - **Scrum:** Iterative sprints with frequent feedback.
    - **Kanban:** Continuous delivery and limiting work in progress.
10. **Spiral Model:** Combines iterative development with structured phases.
11. **V-Model:** Testing phase aligns with each development phase.

- **Choosing an SDLC Model:** Depends on **project size, complexity, team expertise, time constraints, and client involvement**.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - **Government healthcare project**:
        - **Waterfall** for regulatory compliance.
        - **Agile** for flexibility within phases.
        - **Hybrid Model** used for structured but adaptive development.
