## 💡 **What is Software Engineering?**

- **Software:** A set of instructions designed to **solve a problem**, often with documentation.
- **Engineering:** Tools & methods used to **design, build, and maintain** products.
- **Software Engineering:** A combination of **tools and methodologies** to develop and maintain software efficiently.

### 🛠 **Example: Building a Bike vs. Software**

- **Bike:** Requires frame, tires, brakes, and aerodynamics (physics, math).
- **Software:** Requires design, data handling, user experience (UX), and technical tools.

## 🏆 **Software Quality Requirements**

|**Attribute**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|**Dependability**|Works as expected, available when needed.|
|**Maintainability**|Can be updated and modified easily.|
|**Safety**|Prevents harmful or undesirable behavior.|
|**Reliability**|Performs consistently under stated conditions.|
|**Efficiency**|Uses resources optimally, avoids waste.|
|**Usability**|User-friendly, easy interaction, good documentation.|

### 🎭 **Client vs. Engineer Perspective**

- Clients **don’t care** about these technical attributes.
- They **care about benefits** and usability.
- Engineers **must ensure** these qualities for **long-term success**.
