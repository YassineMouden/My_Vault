### **Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics**

- **Definition:** Principles and standards guiding software engineers' professional behavior.
- **Purpose:** Ensures ethical decision-making and considers social impacts of software systems.

### **Examples of Ethical Considerations**

- **Privacy Protection:** Responsible collection, storage, and use of user data.
- **Security:** Preventing cyber threats and unauthorized access.
- **Transparency:** Clearly communicating software capabilities and limitations.
- **Accessibility:** Designing for diverse users, including those with disabilities.
- **Social Responsibility:** Considering broader societal impacts, e.g., AI in decision-making.

### **Importance of Ethics in Software Engineering**

- **Software impacts millions of lives** (e.g., healthcare, finance, education).
- **Ethics prevent harm to users, society, and the environment.**
- **Responsibility for safety, privacy, and overall well-being.**

### **Real-World Ethical Issues & Case Studies**

1. **User Privacy & Data Protection:**
    - **Example:** Facebook-Cambridge Analytica (2018) – misuse of personal data for political purposes.
2. **Public Safety:**
    - **Example:** Boeing 737 Max crashes (2018-2019) – software issues contributed to fatal accidents.
3. **Fairness & Bias Prevention:**
    - **Example:** Amazon’s AI recruiting tool (2018) – biased against women in hiring.
4. **Professional Integrity:**
    - **Example:** Volkswagen emissions scandal (2015) – software used to cheat emissions tests.
5. **Responsible Innovation:**
    - **Example:** Clearview AI – facial recognition tech raised privacy concerns.
6. **Transparency & Accountability:**
    - **Example:** Theranos scandal (2015) – misleading claims about medical tech.
7. **Accessibility & Inclusivity:**
    - **Example:** Domino’s Pizza lawsuit (2019) – website was not accessible to visually impaired users.
8. **Environmental Responsibility:**
    - **Example:** Cryptocurrency mining – high energy consumption.
9. **Protecting Vulnerable Populations:**
    - **Example:** YouTube Kids app – inappropriate content exposed to children.
10. **Ethical Use of Data:**

- **Example:** Strava fitness app (2018) – revealed sensitive military locations via a heatmap.

### **Key Ethical Areas in Software Engineering**

- **Public Safety:** Avoiding harm in critical systems (e.g., medical devices, aviation).
- **Privacy:** Protecting user data and preventing misuse.
- **Intellectual Property:** Respecting software licenses and copyrights.

### **Consequences of Ignoring Ethics**

- **Harm to Users:** Faulty software can cause injuries or fatalities.
    - **Example:** Therac-25 radiation machine (1985-1987) – fatal overdoses due to software bugs.
- **Legal Penalties:** Violations lead to fines and lawsuits.
    - **Example:** Google fined €50M (2019) for GDPR violations.
- **Loss of Public Trust:** Companies face reputation damage.
    - **Example:** Equifax data breach (2017) – 147M people affected.
- **Financial Losses:** Poor ethical practices can lead to financial collapse.
    - **Example:** Knight Capital (2012) – $440M lost in 45 minutes due to software error.
- **Environmental Damage:** Ethical failures can harm ecosystems.
    - **Example:** Volkswagen scandal (2015) – increased pollution due to emissions fraud.

### **Key Ethical Principles in Software Engineering**

1. **Integrity:** Honesty and transparency in work.
2. **Responsibility:** Acknowledging the societal impact of software.
3. **Confidentiality:** Protecting sensitive data.
4. **Public Interest:** Prioritizing safety and well-being.
